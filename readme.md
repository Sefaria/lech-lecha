# Sefaria - Lech-Lecha

This is the repo for Sefaria's submission to the NLI/Yad HaNadiv's [Tarboot contest](https://tarboot.org/)

To run locally change into your new `lech-lecha` directory and start a development server (available at http://localhost:5173):

    cd lech-lecha
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
